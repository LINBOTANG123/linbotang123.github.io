I'm a second-year S.M. student in Data Science at Harvard University, advised by [Prof. Yogesh Rathi](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/people/yogesh-rathi) from Mass General Brigham and [Prof. Todd Zickler](https://zickler.seas.harvard.edu/) from Harvard SEAS. Previously, I earned dual B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Data Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/).

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, generative modeling, and medical imaging — focusing on integrating geometric, temporal, and physical constraints into deep learning frameworks for interpretable and domain-adaptive perception.

I am also passionate about teaching and have served as a Teaching Fellow (Teaching Assistant) for multiple courses at Harvard and UW-Madison. You can find more details about my teaching experience [here](../_pages/teach.md).


### Research Interests
My research interests include:
- Computer Vision
- Medica Imaging
- 3D vision and Scene Understanding

    <h4 style="margin-top:0;">Scanner-Adaptive Coil-Level Denoising for Diffusion MRI Using Explicit Noise Priors</h4>
    <p>Linbo Tang, Qiang Liu, Lipeng Ning, Yogesh Rathi<br>
    <em>In submission to ISBI, 2026</em><br>
    <p>Developed a scanner-adaptive, coil-level denoising framework that conditions on measured noise statistics for robust performance across scanners and protocols. The method achieved up to a 23% reduction in residual noise compared to the next best-performing approach on in-vivo multi-coil diffusion MRI data.<br>

    <h4 style="margin-top:0;">Matadata Matters: Diffusion-Based MRI Reconstruction with Metadata Conditioning</h4>
    <p>Developed a diffusion-based MRI reconstruction framework that leverages fine-grained metadata embeddings to adapt reconstruction across diverse acquisition settings.  Designed a structured embedding architecture and introduced an out-of-distribution training strategy using cardiac MRI data to enhance generalization and interpretability on the fastMRI brain dataset.<br>
