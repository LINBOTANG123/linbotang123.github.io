I'm a second-year S.M. student in Data Science at Harvard University, advised by [Prof. Yogesh Rathi](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/people/yogesh-rathi) from Mass General Brigham and [Prof. Todd Zickler](https://zickler.seas.harvard.edu/) from Harvard SEAS. Previously, I earned dual B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Data Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/).

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, generative modeling, and medical imaging — focusing on integrating geometric, temporal, and physical constraints into deep learning frameworks for interpretable and domain-adaptive perception.

I am also passionate about teaching and have served as a Teaching Fellow (Teaching Assistant) for multiple courses at Harvard and UW-Madison. You can find more details about my teaching experience [here](../_pages/teach.md).
